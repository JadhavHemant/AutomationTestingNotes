TestNG Important Questions
 
NOTE- we can't use main method in testNG.

1) TestNG Advantages:-
	-it is used to create test cases.
	-using TestNG we can maintain the execution flow of test cases.
	-we can prioritized the test cases using testNG.
	-we can run the test cases multiple times and we can run single test within time using testNG.
	-we can parameterization test cases.
	-we can run test cases parallel.
	-we can group the test cases.
	-we can generate html reports using testNG.
	-we can achieve data driven testing using testNG.
	-we can itegrate testNG with maven and gradel build tool.
	-we can execute the test cases withinthe time.

2) Different annotations in testNG or execution sequence of testNG annotatoons
	there are 3 types of annotations
	1) Precondition annotation
		@BeforeSuite
		@BeforeTest
		@BeforeClass
		@BeforeMethod
	
	2) Test annotation
		@Test

	3) Post annotation
		@AfterMethod
		@AfterClass
		@AfterTest
		@AfterSuite

3) how to maintain the test cases execution flow?
	 there are 2 ways we can maintain test cases execution flow
		1) proirity attribute
		2) dependsOnMethods attribute
	

i) proirity attribute-
	-by using priority attribute we maintain the test cases execution flow.
	-default priority is 0 and also we can mention negative priority.
	-we mention same priority for multiple test cases.
	-if we are not mention priority attribute then it will execute as per alphabetically order.

ii) dependsOnMethods attribute-
	
a) hard dependsOnMethods attribute-
	-one method is purely depend on another method.
	- if there are 3 test cases abc,xyz and pqr, and we provide dependsOnMethods attribute for xyz and if abc test case fail
	then it will skip the remaining test cases.

b) soft depensONMethods attribute-
	-to define the dependsOnMethods attribute then we use "alwaysRun" attribute with dependsOnMethods attribute.
	-if there are 3 test cases abc,xyz and pqr, and we provide dependsOnMethods attribute for xyz and if abc test case fail
	then it will run the remaining test cases.

4) can we mention same priority for multiple test cases?
	yes. it will execute as per the alphabetical order.

5) How to ignore the test cases in testNG?

	there are 3 ways in testNG
	i) @Ignore annotation
	ii) enabled = false attribute
	iii) by grouping the test cases and inside the xml file we use exclude tagName by passing group name

i) @Ignore annotation-
	-we use @Ignore annotation before test case.
	
syntax-
	@Ignore
	@Test
	public void abc()
	{
		//statement
	}

ii) enabled = false attribute-
	-we use enabled=false attribute in @Test annotation.
	
syntax-
	@Test(enabled = false)
	public void abc()
	{
		//statement
	}

6) How to run same test case multiple times?
	-we use invocationCount attribute by passing count number.
	
NOTE- if we mention invocationCount zero or negative number then it will ignore the test cases.

syntax-	@Test(invocationCount = 5)
	public void abc()
	{
		//statement
	}

7) How to run test cases within the time?
	-we use timeOut attribute torun the cases within the time by passing time in milliseconds.

syntax-	@Test(timeOut = 2000)
	public void abc()
	{
		//statement
	}

8) difference between @BeforeClass and @BeforeMethod
	-@BeforeClass  is precondition for all the test cases in class.
	-@BeforeMethod is precondition for each and every test cases in a class.

9) difference between @BeforeClass and @BeforeTest
	-@BeforeClass  is precondition for all the test cases in class.
	-@BeforeTest is precondition for all the test cases in classes tags in xml file.

10) difference between @BeforeTest and @AfterTest
	-@BeforeTest is precondition for all the test cases in classes tags in xml file.
	-@AfterTest is postcondition for all the test cases in classes tags in xml file.

11)  difference between @BeforeMethod and  @AfterMethod 
	-@BeforeMethod is precondition for each and every test cases in a class.
	-@AfterMethod is postcondition for each and every test cases in a class.

12) difference between @BeforeClass and @AfterClass
	-@BeforeClass  is precondition for all the test cases in class.
	-@AfterClass is postcondition for all the test cases in class.

13) what are the different tags in xml file?
	<suite name="suite name or project name">
	<parameter name ="parameterName" value ="parameterValue"/>
	<test name ="TC name">
	<classes>
	<class name ="packageName.className"/>
	</classes>
	</test>
	</suite>

14) what is use of @Parameters annotation in testNG ? or how to achieve parameterization in TestNG ?
	
	-we use @Parameters annotation to acheive the parameterization in TestNG.
	-we use @Parameters  annotation in test cases level as Precondition level.
	-@Parameters annotation fetch the values from xml file and we can use these values in test cases.
	-we achieve parallel testing as well as cross browser testing using @Parameters annotation.
	-to achieve the cross browser testing or parallel testing we pass browser names/values from xml file.
